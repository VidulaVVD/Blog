            <h3>Health </h3>
            <p>Health, according to the World Health Organization, is "a state of complete physical, 
                mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity".
                [1] A variety of definitions have been used for different purposes over time.
                 Health can be promoted by encouraging healthful activities, such as regular
                  physical exercise and adequate sleep,[2] and by reducing or avoiding unhealthful activities 
                  or situations, such as smoking or excessive stress. Some factors affecting health are due 
                  to individual choices, such as whether to engage in a high-risk behavior, while others are 
                  due to structural causes, such as whether the society is arranged in a way that makes it 
                  easier or harder for people to get necessary healthcare services. Still, other factors are
                   beyond both individual and group choices, such as genetic disorders.
